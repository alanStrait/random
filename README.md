# Random

## Elixir / Erlang / OTP versions
The latest Erlang/OTP and Elixir were used, including Phoenix 1.7, which includes `Verified Routes`, including the new sigil `~p`, and colocated controller and view modules (directory structure is a bit different than in the past).  Hopefully it is convenient by way of `asdf` or equivalent to run this project with the following versions.
```zsh
Erlang/OTP 25 [erts-13.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:16:16] [ds:16:16:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns]

Elixir 1.14.3 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 25)
```

## Quickstart
[This repository here]

```zsh
git clone _
cd random
mix deps.get
## Be sure Postgres is available with un/pw in `dev.exs`
mix ecto.create
## start phoenix
mix phx.server 
# or
iex -S mix phx.server
# with this option, you can also start the `observer`
:observer.start()
```
API, visit: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

Dashboard, visit: [http://localhost:4000/dev/dashboard/home](http://localhost:4000/dev/dashboard/home)


## My Understanding of the Requirements
This repository contains a backend code exercise with the following highlevel rquirements which reflect my interpretation of provided `Requirements`.  My approach and assumptions are interspersed.

- [x] A good README.md
- [x] Use Postgres
  - [x] See `dev.exs` for `Repo` configuration  
- [x] `mix` commands used to bootstap this project / repository
  - [x] `mix phx.new random --no-assets --no-html --no-gettext --no-mailer`
    - [x] Two URLs are operative given these options
      - [x] `http://localhost:4000/`
        - [x] Endpoint for provided API
      - [x] `http://localhost:4000/dev/dashboard/home`
        - [x] Dashboard when in `dev` mode
  - [x] `mix phx.gen.json Accounts User users points:integer`
    - [x] Only an `index/2` function on the controller was kept in order to provide the single endpoint described
  - [x] All default configuration options kept
  - [x] Unneeded functions and tests were removed along the way
    - [x] An effort was made to implement only the requirements specified, with an exception of baisc CRUD function in the `Accounts` context module
      - [x] `delete_user/1` was removed
- [x] `User` schema with four fields: `id`, `points`, and `timestamps` generated by Ecto, `inserted_at` and `updated_at`
    - [x] On `mix ecto.setup` and `mix ecto.reset` this schema is to have 1_000_000 records with points initialized to zero
      - [x] Initially I was concerned that a singleton `GenServer` was going to be a bottleneck when updating these records, but this turned out to be unfounded given `insert_all` (used in `seeds.exs`) and `update_all` used directly in the `GenServer`.
        - [x] `seeds.exs` loads in approximately 10 seconds
        - [x] Update of all points with new random numbers takes between 10 and 15 seconds, well within the 60 second window
        - [x] `update_all`, by way of `insert_all` with the `on_conflict`, option was kept as a private function in the `GenServer` as it would not be expected to be part of the public API in the context module, `Accounts`, since it circumvents schema validation
- [x] No warnings on application start, `mix phx.server` or `iex -S mix phx.server`
- [x] A singleton data container `GenServer` that:
    - [x] Starts at application startup
    - [x] Manages two properties
      - [x] `min_number` an integer between 0 and 100
      - [x] A timestamp, I chose to call `last_queried`, that is updated on query request, initialized to be `nil`
    - [x] Runs every minute to 
      - [x] Update all 1_000_000 users points with a new random number between 0 and 100
      - [x] Update `min_number` with a new random number between 0 and 100 once points are updated
    - [x] A single `handle_call` that 
      - [x] Finds all users with `points` greater than `min_number`
      - [x] Returns the first two of these users along with the `last_queried` timestamp for the prior query, and
      - [x] Updates `last_queried` with a new timestamp
- [x] A single endpoint for an API call to return two users whose points are greater than `min_number`

## Bootstrap
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
